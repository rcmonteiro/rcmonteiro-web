Today, I took a small leap into the world of microservices! ðŸš€ To begin, I spun up two basic yet crucial services: an authentication service and an API Gateway.

## The Authentication Service

In my user service (user-service), I leveraged the powerful *Fastify* along with *Zod* schema validation to create a basic authentication service. With Zod, I could easily define the data schemas that the service expects to receive and send.
Plus: Free Swagger documentation!

Moreover, I went a step further and set up a dedicated PostgreSQL database to store user authentication information. This will allow me to scale and manage authentication information more effectively as my project grows.

## The API Gateway

And to further streamline communication between my microservices, I put together an API Gateway using *Fastify* and the *@fastify/http-proxy* plugin. This gateway simply redirects incoming requests to the appropriate services based on their routes.

It was a quick and easy setup! With just a few lines of code, I was able to route requests to the correct services, enabling my application to function more cohesively and organized.

Now, with these two basic services up and running, I'm ready to take the next step in the microservices journey. I can't wait to see how these simple foundations pave the way for more complex and powerful solutions!
