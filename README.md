# My Blog Project ðŸ¤˜

Welcome to my blog! This is a simple site where I share what I've been working on. If you enjoy markdown files and static site generators, you'll feel right at home.

## What is this?

This blog was built to practice creating applications with React and TypeScript. Here's how it works:
- **Next.js App Router**: Generates all static pages during the build process.
- **Markdown Content**: All posts are written in markdown files.

## Why should you care?

This setup results in a site that's fast and secure. I even achieved a perfect score on Google Lighthouse at one point! That was before adding Google Analytics, which brought it down to 94. Still, not too shabby!

## Features

- **Static Generation**: All pages are pre-rendered at build time.
- **Markdown Content**: Easy to write, though setting up metadata manually is required for proper relationships.
- **React and TypeScript**: Built with modern web technologies.
- **Performance**: Almost perfect Google Lighthouse score (94 after adding Google Analytics).

## How to Use

To check out the code or run your own version of this blog, clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rcmonteiro/rcmonteiro-web
cd rcmonteiro-web
pnpm i
pnpm run build
pnpm start
```

And there you go! Your very own markdown-powered blog.
